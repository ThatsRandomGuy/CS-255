Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project's goal was to create a system for DriverPass to teach new drivers how to drive. The client was the ownder of DriverPass. The system they wanted was a website to give new drivers access to practice tests and lessons to help them pass their upcoming driving test.

What did you do particularly well?

Something I would say I did particularly well was using LucidChart for the diagram creation. I really like working with LucidChart because of its intuitiveness and resources. Creating diagrams was a breeze, and it gave all the tools I needed to succeed.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would probably go back and change the amount of detail in each diagram. I think that I left out a lot of steps that are required in order for some of the system functions to function. More specifically, I would for sure add some more details about how the packages are purchased from the website.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I took the user's needs as the number one priority. The user's needs are the most important aspect of creating a system. Without the user, there is no need for the system in the first place. I tried to design everything so that the user had the best experience possible.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

The first thing I do when designing software is create a list of user needs. I like to plan out the project before starting and adding to it as needed. In the future, I plan to use more diagrams like I used in this project. The diagrams make software development a lot easier and more intuitive.
